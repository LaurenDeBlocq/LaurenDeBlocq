# Hello, I'm Lauren ðŸ‘‹
I am a recent graduate of the CodeSpace Intro to Software Development course.

It was an eye-opening experience and really got me excited about the world of coding and programming that I've now entered. I love the problem solving and step-by-step approach you need to do when creating different features and fixing bugs.

Feel free to check out my various projects and let me know what you think!
